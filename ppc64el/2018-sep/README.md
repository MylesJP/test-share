This repo contains test results and command outputs for openstack rocky on ubuntu bionic for ppc64el

Please note tha there was one failure related to an issue with the cirros image which caused the single failure in the smoke test.
The same test was re-run with a bionic guest image and passed, indicating a test image issue rather than a functional test failure.
